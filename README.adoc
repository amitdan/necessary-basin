== Running the Example Application Locally

To run this example application on your local host:

[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ git clone git@github.com:amitdan/necessary-basin

$ cd necessary-basin

$ npm install && npm start
----

== Running the Example Application on a Single-node OpenShift Cluster
If you have a single-node OpenShift cluster, such as Minishift or Red Hat Container Development Kit, link:http://launcher.fabric8.io/docs/minishift-installation.html[installed and running], you can also deploy your example application there. A single-node OpenShift cluster provides you with access to a cloud environment that is similar to a production environment.

To deploy your example application to a running single-node OpenShift cluster:
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc login -u developer -p developer

$ oc new-project MY_PROJECT_NAME

$ npm install && npm run openshift
----

== More Information
You can learn more about this example application and rest of the Node.js runtime in the link:http://launcher.fabric8.io/docs/nodejs-runtime.html[Node.js Runtime Guide].

== Red Hat tools used
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
1.Red Hat Application Runtime - NodeJs and SpringBoot
2.OpenShift Container platform
3.Red Hat Fuse
4.Red Hat AMQ
5.Red Hat 3scale
6.Red Hat Single Sign-on (SSO)
----


== How did I use Red Hat tools ?
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
1.Red Hat Application Runtime - NodeJs and SpringBoot : React app is running on top of NodeJs runtime and Microservice is running on top of SpringBoot Runtime. We used it to maintain cloud native architecture.
2.OpenShift Container platform - Responsible to deploy and run my web app in cloud container.
3.Red Hat Fuse : We integrated React client, Backend microservice and postgress database using Red Hat Fuse.
4.Red Hat AMQ : To achieve event based messaging asynchronously we used AMQ streams/messaging broker
5.Red Hat 3scale : Exposed Rest API's through 3scale to third party and community to search EV chargig and swapping stations.We alos planning to monotize through 3scale.
6.Red Hat Single Sign-on (SSO) : Used Red hat SSO to incorporate SAML 2.0,OpenId connect and OAuth2.0 to secure web application with cutting edge technology.
